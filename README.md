#### Description
This weeks challenge invited us to build from scratch a MVC style application that functions like the basic essentials of a social networking application. We have the ability to add and delete users, thoughts or "posts" and reply to those thoughts with "reactions". while there is no front end capabilities, this simulates the functionality of an extremely common feature for most websites, not only social media sites.
